Currently Ohio State Court Statistics are reported in a nearly 300 page Statistical Annual Report. 
Analysis of report is inherently limited by the static document medium. 
Data and analysis presented are usually limited to the year in focus and cannot be easily seen in context of historical data and trends. 
Decisions made by Judicial Branch Stakeholders without taking advantage of powerful data science techniques can at best leave cost savings on the table or at worst lead to delay in justice.
